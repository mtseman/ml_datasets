It is our goal to keep the tradition of agriculture present, even in this day and age where things are becoming more digital and technology-based. We offer families a place to explore and feel the sense of community that Marathon County really has to offer.
The fair may only be six days long, but the impact of it is seen year round. We are able to partner with 4-H and local FFA chapters to allow youth a place to display their work. Kids put a lot of effort and time into readying their projects for the fair. Since we are truly the fair of Marathon County, our Open Class projects allow area adults a similar opportunity.
We also have many educational displays throughout the grounds to enrich the knowledge of fair-goers. With an average attendance of over 140,000 people, we have the unique position of being able to connect with many individuals at just one event. We allow day cares, nursing homes and other facilities to bring groups of residents to enjoy the fair with no cost to them.",0,0
1855,Marathon,Non-Profit Agencies,Marathon County Historical Society,"Since 1952, the Marathon County Historical Society’s mission has been to collect, preserve  and publish the history of Marathon County. In 1953, the Marathon County Board of Supervisors voted that it was within their authority to provide Snancial assistance to the Marathon County Historical Society in support of their mission to preserve the history of Marathon County and provide educational programming for our schools and community.
At the Marathon County Historical Society, we have continued this mission since that time and have continued to increase the resources and services that we provide to the county and community. Currently 53% of the Woodson History Center is dedicated to climate controlled, secure storage for our artifacts and archives. The remainder of the building is used for rotating historical exhibits, displays and a research library. The majority of these services are free and open to the public.
Our archives contain many original documents and records including the Marathon County Board Proceedings beginning March 4, 1850, Marathon County Probate Records from 1850 through 1918, Board of Supervisors Bull Falls Township records 1840-1844, Court Records and Decisions from the early 1800s and more. Also included are a large collection of Marathon County marriage records, probate records, election records, highway department records, farm journals, agriculture and fair records, school records, tax records, original township records of many townships throughout the county, and much more. In fact, 38% of our archives contains the original documents and records of the Marathon County Board of Supervisors, various Marathon County Departments, schools and townships. The remaining 62% of the archives contains photos, documents and records of people, places and events related to Marathon County.
We provide safe, secure storage for these original documents and records and make them available to county staff and researchers who visit our facility. This information is also used to develop our programs, displays and exhibits covering a variety of county-wide topics. Our current exhibits include Milking Time: Evolution of the Dairy Industry in Marathon County and Rural ElectriScation: Outlet for Change. Previous exhibits included Generations of Progress: Industrial History of Marathon County and Pieces of the Past: Quilts Tell A Story, featuring historic quilts from individuals and homemakers groups around Marathon County. Through these exhibits, as well as through our programs and displays, we are able to capture various aspects of the community character throughout Marathon County, and document and tell their story.
   Our upcoming exhibit will open in 2021 and will tell the story of Hmong Immigration into Marathon County. Even though this represents the 45th anniversary of the Srst Hmong arriving in the area, we have collected very few artifacts, documents, photos, etc. to document their arrival. We have partnered with Yee Leng Xiong, from the Hmong American Center to begin collecting and preserving this important story. We will use these new collections to tell the story of a group of Marathon County residents that has never told. Also in 2021, we will be telling the story of the Marathon County Park Commission and the history of the parks in Marathon County through a traveling exhibit and also through our mobile walking tour app, Vamonde.
The information in the documents and records that we preserve and use for our programming, displays and exhibits, such as the Marathon County Probate records, cannot be found or duplicated anywhere else and have become a valuable resource for researchers and the entire community. Preserving these documents and records for Marathon County Board of Supervisors, departments, schools and townships has been an important part of our mission for many years and will continue to be a priority in the future.
Another important part of our mission is to provide educational programming throughout Marathon County. Each year, our staff is approached by public libraries, schools, groups and organizations throughout Marathon County to give programs or create displays or exhibits on a variety of topics related to the history of Marathon County. In 2018 alone, our staff responded to 121 of these requests for a variety of services that we provided throughout the County, directly serving 3,937 people and indirectly serving thousands more who were able to view our traveling displays and exhibits. The places we visited include Hatley, Mosinee, Stratford, Athens and Spencer to name a few. In addition, our Little Red Schoolhouse program served 1,612 fourth grade students from 38 different schools around Marathon County. This program gains in popularity each year, with more and more schools asking to participate. We also served an additional 12,276 individuals and members of school groups, clubs and organizations who visited our facility for a variety of programs, events and exhibits. In total we served 17,825 people in 2018, a 44% increase over 2017.
Through our wide variety of programming, we reach people of all ages and social and economic background. Our children and school programs reach children from pre-school through high school. We offer family-friendly events in the summer and participate in community-wide events such as Farm Technology Days, Harvest Fest, Summer Kick-off,
